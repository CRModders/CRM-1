# CRM-1 // "Mod Repository Spec"
A specification for Cosmic Reach mod repositories.

## Why?
This spec was created to allow mod developers to have their mods directly downloadable within launchers.

## Format?
See repository.json.

Please note that the "ext" object is for extensions, not regulated by this specification. It is for OPTIONAL additional data like icons that can be loaded by launchers, not crucial information.

### This will be elaborated on in the future.
